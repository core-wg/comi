--- abstract

This document describes a network management interface for constrained devices
and networks, called CoAP Management Interface (CORECONF). The Constrained Application
Protocol (CoAP) is used to access datastore and data node resources specified
in YANG, or SMIv2 converted to YANG. CORECONF uses the YANG to CBOR mapping and converts
YANG identifier strings to numeric identifiers for payload size reduction.
CORECONF extends the set of YANG based
protocols, NETCONF and RESTCONF, with the capability to manage constrained devices
and networks.

# Introduction {#introduction}

The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) {{RFC7252}} is designed for
Machine to Machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy, smart city, and building control.
Constrained devices need to be managed in an automatic fashion to handle
the large quantities of devices that are expected in
future installations. Messages between devices need to be as small and
infrequent as possible. The implementation
complexity and runtime resources need to be as small as possible.

This draft describes the CoAP Management Interface (CORECONF) which uses CoAP methods
to access structured data defined in YANG {{RFC7950}}. This draft is
complementary to {{RFC8040}} which describes a REST-like interface
called RESTCONF, which uses HTTP methods to access structured data
defined in YANG.

The use of standardized data models specified in a standardized language, such
as YANG, promotes interoperability between devices and applications from
different manufacturers.

CORECONF and RESTCONF are intended to work in a stateless client-server fashion.
They use a single round-trip to complete a single editing transaction, where
NETCONF needs multiple round trips.

To promote small messages, CORECONF uses a YANG to CBOR mapping
{{-yang-cbor}} and numeric identifiers {{I-D.ietf-core-sid}}
to minimize CBOR payloads and URI length.

## Terminology {#terminology}

The following terms are defined in the YANG data modeling language {{RFC7950}}: action, anydata, anyxml, client, container, data model, data node, identity, instance identifier, leaf, leaf-list, list, module, RPC, schema node, server, submodule.

The following terms are defined in {{RFC6241}}: configuration data, datastore, state data.

The following term is defined in {{I-D.ietf-core-sid}}: YANG schema item identifier (YANG SID, often shortened to simply SID).

The following terms are defined in the CoAP protocol {{RFC7252}}: Confirmable Message, Content-Format, Endpoint.

The following terms are defined in this document:

data node resource:
: a CoAP resource that models a YANG data node.

datastore resource:
: a CoAP resource that models a YANG datastore.

event stream resource:
: a CoAP resource used by clients to observe YANG notifications.

notification instance:
: An instance of a schema node of type notification, specified in a YANG module
  implemented by the server. The instance is generated in the server at the occurrence
  of the corresponding event and reported by an event stream resource.

list instance identifier:
: Handle used to identify a YANG data node that is an instance of a YANG "list",
  specified with the values of the key leaves of the list.


single instance identifier:
: Handle used to identify a specific data node which can be instantiated only
  once. This includes data nodes defined at the root of a YANG module and
  data nodes defined within a container. This excludes data nodes defined
  within a list or any children of these data nodes.

instance-identifier:
: List instance identifier or single instance identifier.

instance-value:
: The value assigned to a data node instance. Instance-values are serialized into
  the payload according to the rules defined in {{Section 4 of -yang-cbor}}.
  In a yang-instances data item, the reference SID applying to the
  instance-value is provided by the SID in the corresponding instance-identifier.


{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

## Example syntax {#example-syntax}

CBOR is used to encode CORECONF request and response payloads. The CBOR syntax
of the YANG payloads is specified in {{-yang-cbor}}, based on {{RFC8949}}
and {{-seq}}.
The payload examples are
notated in Diagnostic notation (defined in {{Section 8 of RFC8949}} and
{{Appendix G of RFC8610}}), which
can be automatically converted to CBOR.



# CORECONF Architecture {#comi-architecture}

This section describes the CORECONF architecture to use CoAP for reading and
modifying the content of datastore(s) used for the management of the instrumented
node.

{: #archit title='Abstract CORECONF architecture' artwork-align="left"}

 {{archit}} is a high-level representation of the main elements of the CORECONF management
architecture. The different numbered components of {{archit}} are discussed according to the component number.


(1) YANG specification:
: contains a set of named and versioned modules.


(2) SMIv2 specification:
: Optional part that consists of a named module which, specifies a set of variables and "conceptual tables". There
  is an algorithm to translate SMIv2 specifications to YANG specifications.


(3) CoAP request/response messages:
: The CORECONF client sends request messages to and receives response messages
  from the CORECONF server.


(4) Request, Indication, Response, Confirm:
: Processes performed by the CORECONF clients and servers.


(5) Datastore:
: A resource used to access configuration data, state data, RPCs, and actions. A CORECONF server may support a single unified datastore or multiple datastores as those defined by Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) {{RFC8342}}.


(6) Event stream:
: A resource used to get real-time notifications. A CORECONF server may support multiple Event streams serving different purposes such as normal monitoring, diagnostic, syslog, security monitoring.


(7) Security:
: The server MUST prevent unauthorized users from reading or writing any CORECONF
  resources. CORECONF relies on security protocols such as DTLS {{RFC6347}}{{-dtls13}} or OSCORE {{RFC8613}} to secure CoAP communications.


## Major differences between RESTCONF and CORECONF {#major-differences}

CORECONF is a RESTful protocol for small devices where saving bytes to
transport a message is very important. Contrary to RESTCONF, many design
decisions are motivated by the
saving of bytes. Consequently, CORECONF is not a RESTCONF over CoAP protocol,
but differs more significantly from RESTCONF.

### Differences due to CoAP and its efficient usage {#major-differences-coap}

* CORECONF uses CoAP/UDP as transport protocol and CBOR as payload format
  {{-yang-cbor}}. RESTCONF uses HTTP/TCP as transport
  protocol and JSON or XML as payload formats.

* CORECONF uses the methods FETCH and iPATCH to access data nodes.
  RESTCONF uses instead the HTTP method PATCH and the HTTP method GET with the "fields" Query parameter.

* RESTCONF uses the HTTP methods HEAD, and OPTIONS, which are not supported by CoAP.

* CORECONF does not support "insert" query parameter (first, last, before, after)
  and the "point" query parameter which are supported by RESTCONF.

* CORECONF does not support the "start-time" and "stop-time" query parameters
  to retrieve past notifications.

### Differences due to the use of CBOR {#major-differences-cbor}

* CORECONF encodes YANG identifier strings as numbers, where RESTCONF does not.

* CORECONF also differs in the handling of default values, only 'report-all' and 'trim' options are supported.

## Compression of YANG identifiers {#id-compression}

In the YANG specification, items are identified with a name string. In order
to significantly reduce the size of identifiers used in CORECONF, numeric
 identifiers called YANG Schema Item iDentifier (YANG SID or simply SID) are used instead.

### Instance-identifiers {#instance-identifier}

Instance-identifiers are used to uniquely identify data node instances within a datastore. This YANG built-in type is defined in {{Section 9.13 of RFC7950}}. An instance-identifier is composed of the data node identifier (i.e., a SID) and, for data nodes within list(s), the keys used to index within these list(s).

In CORECONF, instance-identifiers are carried in the payload of FETCH
and PATCH requests.
They are encoded in CBOR
based on the rules defined in {{Section 6.13.1 of -yang-cbor}}.


## Media-Types {#media-type}

CORECONF uses Media-Types based on the YANG to CBOR mapping specified
in {{-yang-cbor}}.

The following new Media-Types based on CBOR sequences {{-seq}} are defined in this document:

application/yang-identifiers+cbor-seq:

: This Media-Type represents a CBOR YANG document containing a list of instance-identifiers used to target specific data node instances within a datastore.

: FORMAT: CBOR sequence of instance-identifiers

: The message payload of Media-Type 'application/yang-identifiers+cbor-seq' is encoded using a CBOR sequence.
  Each item of this CBOR sequence contains an instance-identifier encoded as defined in {{Section 6.13.1 of -yang-cbor}}.

application/yang-instances+cbor-seq:

: This Media-Type represents a CBOR YANG document containing a list of data node instances.
  Each data node instance is identified by its associated instance-identifier.

: FORMAT: CBOR sequence of CBOR maps of instance-identifier, instance-value

: The message payload of Media-Type 'application/yang-instances+cbor-seq' is encoded using a CBOR sequence.
  Each item within this CBOR sequence contains a CBOR map carrying an instance-identifier and associated instance-value.
  Instance-identifiers are encoded using the rules defined in {{Section
  6.13.1 of -yang-cbor}}, instance-values are encoded using the rules
  defined in {{Section 4 of -yang-cbor}}.
  The reference SID applying to the instance-value is provided by the
  SID in the instance-identifier.

: When present in an iPATCH request payload, this Media-Type carry a list of data node instances to be replaced, created, or deleted.
  For each data node instance D, for which the instance-identifier is the same as a data node instance I, in the targeted datastore resource: the value of D replaces the value of I.  When the value of D is null, the data node instance I is removed.  When the targeted datastore resource does not contain a data node instance with the same instance-identifier as D, a new instance is created with the same instance-identifier and value as D (unless the value of D is null).


The different Media-Type usages are summarized in the table below:

| Method         | Resource     | Media-Type                           |
| FETCH request  | datastore    | application/yang-identifiers+cbor-seq |
| FETCH response | datastore    | application/yang-instances+cbor-seq   |
| iPATCH request | datastore    | application/yang-instances+cbor-seq   |
| GET response   | event stream | application/yang-instances+cbor-seq   |
| POST request   | rpc, action  | application/yang-instances+cbor-seq   |
| POST response  | rpc, action  | application/yang-instances+cbor-seq   |
{: align="left" title="Summary of Media-Type Usages"}

## Unified datastore {#unified-datastore}

CORECONF supports a simple datastore model consisting of a single unified datastore. This datastore provides access to both configuration and operational data. Configuration updates performed on this datastore are reflected immediately or with a minimal delay as operational data.

Alternatively, CORECONF servers MAY implement a more complex datastore model such as the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as defined by {{RFC8342}}. Each datastore supported is implemented as a datastore resource.

Characteristics of the unified datastore are summarized in the table below:

| Name          | Value                                             |
| Name          | unified                                           |
| YANG modules  | all modules                                       |
| YANG nodes    | all data nodes ("config true" and "config false") |
| Access        | read-write                                        |
| How applied   | changes applied in place immediately or with a minimal delay  |
| Protocols     | CORECONF                                              |
| Defined in    | "ietf-coreconf"                                       |
{: align="left" title="Characteristics of the Unified Datastore"}

# CoAP Interface {#coap-interface}

This document specifies a Management Interface. CoAP endpoints that
implement the CORECONF management protocol, support
at least one discoverable management resource of resource type (rt): core.c.ds.
The path of the discoverable management resource is left to implementers to
select (see {{discovery}}).

YANG data node instances are accessible by performing FETCH and iPATCH
operations on the datastore resource.

CORECONF also supports event stream resources used to observe notification instances.
Event stream resources can be discovered using resource type (rt): core.c.ev.

The description of the CORECONF management interface is shown in the table below:

| CoAP resource                | Example path  | rt          |
| Datastore resource           | /c            | core.c.ds   |
| Default event stream resource | /s            | core.c.ev   |
{: #tbl-resources align="left" title="Resources, example paths, and resource types (rt)"}

The path values in the table are example ones. On discovery, the server makes
the actual path values known for these resources.

The methods used by CORECONF are:

| Operation | Description                                                                       |
| FETCH     | Retrieve specific data nodes within a datastore resource                          |
| iPATCH    | Idempotently create, replace, and delete data node(s) within a datastore resource |
| POST      | Invoke an RPC or action                                                           |
| GET       | Retrieve the datastore resource or event stream resource                          |
| PUT       | Create or replace a datastore resource                                            |
| DELETE    | Delete a datastore resource                                                       |
{: #tbl-methods align="left" title="CoAP Methods in CORECONF"}


## Data Retrieval {#data-retrieval}

One or more data nodes can be retrieved by the client.
The operation is mapped to the FETCH method defined in {{Section 2 of RFC8132}}.

There are two additional query parameters for the FETCH method:

| query parameters | Description                                                                         |
| c                | Control selection of configuration and non-configuration data nodes (GET and FETCH) |
| d                | Control retrieval of default values.                                                |
{: #tbl-query-fetch align="left"}

### Using the 'c' query parameter {#content}

The 'c' (content) option controls how descendant nodes of the
requested data nodes will be processed in the reply.

The allowed values are:

| Value | Description |
|  c    |  Return only configuration descendant data nodes |
|  n    |  Return only non-configuration descendant data nodes  |
|  a    |  Return all descendant data nodes  |
{: #tbl-c-values align="left" title="Values for the 'c' query parameter"}

This option is only allowed for GET and FETCH methods on datastore and
data node resources.  A 4.02 (Bad Option) error is returned if used for other
methods or resource types.

If this query parameter is not present, the default value is "a" (the quotes
are added for readability, but they are not part of the payload).


### Using the 'd' query parameter {#dquery}

The 'd' (with-defaults) option controls how the default values of the
descendant nodes of the requested data nodes will be processed.

The allowed values are:

| Value | Description                                                                                           |
| a     | All data nodes are reported. Defined as 'report-all' in {{Section 3.1 of RFC6243}}.                   |
| t     | Data nodes set to the YANG default are not reported. Defined as 'trim' in {{Section 3.2 of RFC6243}}.     |
{: #tbl-d-values align="left" title="Values for the 'd' query parameter"}

If the target of a GET or FETCH method is a data node that represents a leaf
that has a default value, and the leaf has not been given a value by any
client yet, the server MUST return the default value of the leaf.

If the target of a GET method is a data node that represents a
container or list that has child resources with default values,
and these have not been given a value yet,

> The server MUST NOT return the child resource if `d`=`t`.

> The server MUST return the child resource if `d`=`a`.

If this query parameter is not present, the default value is "t" (the quotes are
added for readability, but they are not part of the payload).

### FETCH {#fetch}

The FETCH method is used to retrieve one or more instance-values.
The FETCH request payload contains the list of instance-identifiers of the data node instances requested.

The return response payload contains a list of data node instance-values in the same order as requested.
A CBOR null is returned for each data node requested by the client, not supported by the server or not currently instantiated.

For compactness, indexes of the list instance identifiers returned by the FETCH response SHOULD be elided, only the SID is provided.
This approach may also help reduce implementation complexity since the format of each entry within the CBOR sequence of the FETCH response is identical to the format of the corresponding GET response.

## Data Editing {#data-editing}

CORECONF allows datastore contents to be created, modified and deleted using
CoAP methods.

### Data Ordering {#DataOrdering}

A CORECONF server MUST preserve the relative order of all user-ordered list
and leaf-list entries that are received in a single edit request.
As per {{-yang-cbor}}, these YANG data node types are encoded as CBOR
arrays, so messages will preserve their order.

### POST {#post-operation}

The CoAP POST operation is used in CORECONF for the
invocation of "ACTION" and "RPC" resources.
Refer to {{rpc}} for details on "ACTION" and "RPC" resources.


### iPATCH {#ipatch-operation}

One or multiple data node instances are replaced with the idempotent
CoAP iPATCH method {{RFC8132}}.

There are no query parameters for the iPATCH method.

The processing of the iPATCH command is specified by Media-Type application/yang-instances+cbor-seq.
In summary, if the CBOR patch payload contains a data node instance that is not present
in the target, this instance is added. If the target contains the specified instance,
the content of this instance is replaced with the value of the payload.
A null value indicates the removal of an existing data node instance.

#### iPATCH example {#ipatch-example}

In this example, a CORECONF client requests the following operations:

  * Remove the server "tac.nrc.ca" from the "/ietf-system:system/ntp/server" (SID 1756) list.

A data node resource is deleted using an iPATCH with a null value, as seen in this example.



## Full datastore access {#datastore-access}

The methods GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE can be used to request, replace, create,
and delete a whole datastore respectively.

### Full datastore examples {#datastore-example}

The example uses the interface list from module ietf-interfaces {{RFC8343}} and
the clock container from module ietf-system {{RFC7317}}.
We assume that the datastore contains two modules ietf-system (SID 1700) and
ietf-interfaces (SID 1500); they contain the 'interface' list (SID 1533) with
one instance and the 'clock' container (SID 1721). After invocation of GET, a
CBOR map with data nodes from these two modules is returned:


~~~~
REQ:  GET </c>

## Event stream {#event-stream}

Event notification is an essential function for the management of servers.
CORECONF allows notifications specified in YANG {{RFC5277}} to be reported to a list
of clients. The path for the default event stream can be discovered as
described in {{coap-interface}}. The server MAY support additional event
stream resources to address different notification needs.

Reception of notification instances is enabled with the CoAP Observe
{{RFC7641}} function. Clients subscribe to the notifications by sending a
GET request with an "Observe" option to the stream resource.

Each response payload carries one or multiple notifications. The number of
notifications reported, and the conditions used to remove notifications
from the reported list are left to implementers.
When multiple notifications are reported, they MUST be ordered starting from
the newest notification at index zero. Note that this could lead to
notifications being sent multiple times, which increases the probability for
the client to receive them, but it might potentially lead to messages that
exceed the MTU of a single CoAP packet. If such cases could arise, implementers
should make sure appropriate fragmentation is available - for example the one
described in {{block}}.

The format of notifications is a CBOR sequence, where each item in
the sequence is a single notification as described in {{Section 4.2.1
of -yang-cbor}}.
(Accordingly, a notification without any content is an empty CBOR
sequence, i.e., zero bytes.)

~~~~
FORMAT:
  GET <stream-resource> Observe(0)

  2.05 Content (Content-Format: application/yang-instances+cbor-seq)
  CBOR sequence of CBOR maps of instance-identifier, instance-value
~~~~

The sequence of data node instances may contain identical items which have
been generated at different times.

An example implementation is:

> Every time an event is generated, the generated notification instance is
> appended to the chosen stream(s). After an aggregation period, which may be
> limited by the maximum number of notifications supported,
> the content of the instance is sent to all clients observing the modified stream.

### Filtering Notifications

If only a subset of all possible notifications is of interest, a FETCH
operation can be performed with a request payload of type
application/yang-identifiers+cbor-seq that indicates which subset.

~~~~
FORMAT:
  FETCH <stream-resource> Observe(0)
        (Content-Format: application/yang-identifiers+cbor-seq)
  CBOR sequence of instance-identifiers

  2.05 Content (Content-Format: application/yang-instances+cbor-seq)
  CBOR sequence of CBOR maps of instance-identifier, instance-value
~~~~

When filtering is not supported by a CORECONF server, the request
payload can be ignored: all event notifications are then reported
independently of the presence and content of the request payload.


### Notify Examples {#event-stream-example}

Let suppose the server generates the example-port-fault event as defined below.

~~~~ yang
module example-port {
  yang-version 1.1;
  namespace "https://example.com/ns/example-port";
  prefix "port";

  notification example-port-fault {   // SID 60010
    description
      "Event generated if a hardware fault is detected";
    leaf port-name {                  // SID 60011
      type string;
    }
    leaf port-fault {                 // SID 60012
      type string;
    }
  }
}
~~~~

In this example the default event stream resource path /s is an example
location discovered with a request similar to {{discovery-ex-es}}. By executing a
GET with Observe 0 on the default event stream resource the client receives the
following response:

~~~~
REQ:  GET </s> Observe(0)

RES:  2.05 Content
      (Content-Format: application/yang-instances+cbor-seq)
      Observe(12)

{
  60010 : {             / example-port-fault (SID 60010) /
    1 : "0/4/21",       / port-name (SID 60011) /
    2 : "Open pin 2"    / port-fault (SID 60012) /
  }
},
{
  60010 : {             / example-port-fault (SID 60010) /
    1 : "1/4/21",       / port-name (SID 60011) /
    2 : "Open pin 5"    / port-fault (SID 60012) /
  }
}

~~~~

In the example, the request returns a success response with the contents
of the last two generated events. Consecutively the server will regularly
notify the client when a new event is generated.

A client that wants to filter notifications can use a FETCH payload:

~~~~
REQ:  FETCH </s> Observe(0)
      (Content-Format: application/yang-identifiers+cbor-seq)

60010, 60020 /CBOR sequence with two notification identifiers/

RES:  2.05 Content
      (Content-Format: application/yang-instances+cbor-seq)
      Observe(12)

{
  60010 : {             / example-port-fault (SID 60010) /
    1 : "0/4/21",       / port-name (SID 60011) /
    2 : "Open pin 2"    / port-fault (SID 60012) /
  }
},
{
  60010 : {             / example-port-fault (SID 60010) /
    1 : "1/4/21",       / port-name (SID 60011) /
    2 : "Open pin 5"    / port-fault (SID 60012) /
  }
}

~~~~

Note that the notifications in this example are identical to the
unfiltered example as they are all using identifier SID 60010 and this
is included in the filter.


## RPC statements {#rpc}

The YANG "action" and "RPC" statements specify the execution of a Remote
Procedure Call (RPC) in the server.  It is invoked using a POST method to
an "Action" or "RPC" resource instance.

The request payload contains the values assigned to the input container when specified.
The response payload contains the values of the output container when specified.
Both the input and output containers are encoded in CBOR using the rules defined in
{{Section 4.2.1 of -yang-cbor}}.

The returned success response code is 2.05 Content.


~~~~

### RPC Example {#rpc-example}

This example is based on {{Section 3.6.1 of -restconf}}, abbreviated and
annotated with SIDs as follows:


~~~~ yang
module example-ops {
  yang-version 1.1;
  namespace "https://example.com/ns/example-ops";
  prefix "ops";

  rpc reboot {                          // SID 61000
    description "Reboot operation.";
    input {                             // SID 61009
      leaf delay {                      // SID 61001
        type uint32;
        units "seconds";
        default 0;
        description
          "Number of seconds to wait before initiating the
           reboot operation.";
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~~

This example invokes the 'reboot' RPC  (SID 61000),
of the server instance with name equal to "myserver".


~~~~
REQ:  POST </c>
      (Content-Format: application/yang-instances+cbor-seq)

<!--
We now believe this is the correct empty return for an RPC without output.
    Note that we always have to send a yang-instances (or at least a
    yang-identifiers) for the input side to find the right RPC.

### Action Example {#action-example}

The example is based on the YANG action "reset" as defined in {{Section 7.15.3 of RFC7950}}
and annotated below with SIDs.

~~~~ yang

    leaf name {                        // SID 60001
      type string;
    }
    action reset {                     // SID 60002
      input {                          // SID 60008
        leaf reset-at {                // SID 60003
          type yang:date-and-time;
          mandatory true;
        }
      }
      output {                         // SID 60009
        leaf reset-finished-at {       // SID 60004

          mandatory true;
        }
      }

# Use of Block-wise Transfers {#block}

The CoAP protocol provides reliability by acknowledging the UDP datagrams.
However, when large pieces of data need to be transported, datagrams get
fragmented, thus creating constraints on the resources in the client, server
and intermediate routers. The block option {{RFC7959}} allows the transport
of the total payload in individual blocks of which the
size can be adapted to the underlying transport sizes such as: (UDP datagram
size ~64KiB, IPv6 MTU of 1280, IEEE 802.15.4 payload of 60-80 bytes). Each
block is individually acknowledged to guarantee reliability.

Notice that the Block mechanism splits the data at fixed positions,
such that individual data fields may become fragmented. Therefore, assembly
of multiple blocks may be required to process complete data fields.

Beware of race conditions. In case blocks are filled one at a time, care should
be taken that the whole and consistent data representation is sent in multiple blocks sequentially
without interruption. On the server, values might change, lists might get re-ordered,
extended or reduced. When these actions happen during the serialization of
the contents of the resource, the transported results do not correspond with
a state having occurred in the server; or worse the returned values are inconsistent.
For example: array length does not correspond with the actual number of items.
It may be advisable to use Indefinite-length CBOR arrays and maps,
which are foreseen for data streaming purposes.
(Note that the outer structure of yang-identifiers and yang-instances
is a CBOR sequence, which already behaves similar to an
indefinite-length encoded array.)


# Application Discovery {#discovery}

Two application discovery mechanisms are supported by CORECONF, the YANG library
data model as defined by {{I-D.ietf-core-yang-library}} and
the CORE resource discovery {{RFC6690}}.
Implementers may choose to implement one or the other or both.

## YANG library

The YANG library data model {{I-D.ietf-core-yang-library}} provides a high-level description of the resources available. The YANG library contains the
list of modules, features, and deviations supported by the CORECONF server.
From this information, CORECONF clients can infer the list of data nodes supported
and the interaction model to be used to access them. This module also contains
the list of datastores implemented.

As described in {{RFC6690}}, the location of the YANG library can be found by
sending a GET request to
"/.well-known/core" including a resource type (RT) parameter with the value
"core.c.yl". Upon success, the return payload will contain the root resource
of the YANG library module.

The following example assumes that the SID of the YANG library is 2351 (`kv` after
encoding as specified in {{id-compression}}) and that the server uses /c as
datastore resource path.

~~~~
REQ: GET </.well-known/core?rt=core.c.yl>

RES: 2.05 Content (Content-Format: application/link-format)
</c/kv>;rt="core.c.yl"
~~~~

## Resource Discovery

As some CoAP interfaces and services might not support the YANG library
interface and still be interested to discover resources that are available,
implementations MAY choose to support discovery of all available
resources using "/.well-known/core" as defined by {{RFC6690}}.

### Datastore Resource Discovery

The presence and location of (path to) each datastore implemented by the CORECONF server
can be discovered by sending a GET request to "/.well-known/core" including a
resource type (RT) parameter with the value "core.c.ds".

Upon success, the return payload contains the list of datastore resources.

Each datastore returned is further qualified using the "ds" Link-Format attribute.
This attribute is set to the SID assigned to the datastore identity.
When a unified datastore is implemented, the ds attribute is set to 1029 as
specified in {{ietf-coreconf-sid}}.
For other examples of datastores, see the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) {{RFC7950}}.

~~~~ abnf
link-extension    = ( "ds" "=" sid )
                    ; SID assigned to the datastore identity
sid               = 1*DIGIT
~~~~


The following example assumes that the server uses /c as datastore resource
path.

~~~~
REQ: GET </.well-known/core?rt=core.c.ds>

RES: 2.05 Content (Content-Format: application/link-format)
</c>; rt="core.c.ds";ds=1029
~~~~
{: #discovery-ex-ds artwork-align="left"}

### Data node Resource Discovery

If implemented, the presence and location of (path to) each data node
implemented by the CORECONF server are discovered by sending a GET request to
"/.well-known/core" including a resource type (RT) parameter with the value
"core.c.dn".

Upon success, the return payload contains the SID assigned to each data node
and their location.

The example below shows the discovery of the presence and location of
data nodes. Data nodes '/ietf-system:system-state/clock/boot-datetime' (SID 1722)
and '/ietf-system:system-state/clock/current-datetime' (SID 1723) are returned.
The example assumes that the server uses /c as datastore resource path.


~~~~
REQ: GET </.well-known/core?rt=core.c.dn>

RES: 2.05 Content (Content-Format: application/link-format)
</c/a6>;rt="core.c.dn",
</c/a7>;rt="core.c.dn"
~~~~

Without additional filtering, the list of data nodes may become prohibitively
long. If this is the case implementations SHOULD support a way to obtain all
links using multiple GET requests (for example through some form of
pagination).

### Event stream Resource Discovery

The presence and location of (path to) each event stream implemented by the CORECONF server are
discovered by sending a GET request to "/.well-known/core" including a resource type (RT)
parameter with the value "core.c.es".

Upon success, the return payload contains the list of event stream resources.

The following example assumes that the server uses /s as the default event stream
resource.

~~~~
REQ: GET </.well-known/core?rt=core.c.es>

RES: 2.05 Content (Content-Format: application/link-format)
</s>;rt="core.c.es"
~~~~
{: #discovery-ex-es artwork-align="left"}


# Error Handling {#error-handling}

In case a request is received which cannot be processed properly, the CORECONF server MUST return an error response. This error response MUST contain a CoAP 4.xx or 5.xx response code.

Errors returned by a CORECONF server can be broken into two categories, those associated with the CoAP protocol itself and those generated during the validation of the YANG data model constraints as described in {{Section 8 of RFC7950}}.

The following list of common CoAP errors should be implemented by CORECONF servers. This list is not exhaustive, other errors defined by CoAP and associated RFCs may be applicable.

* Error 4.01 (Unauthorized) is returned by the CORECONF server when the CORECONF client is not authorized to perform the requested action on the targeted resource (i.e., data node, datastore, rpc, action or event stream).

* Error 4.02 (Bad Option) is returned by the CORECONF server when one or more CoAP options are unknown or malformed.

* Error 4.04 (Not Found) is returned by the CORECONF server when the CORECONF client is requesting a non-instantiated resource (i.e., data node, datastore, rpc, action or event stream).

* Error 4.05 (Method Not Allowed) is returned by the CORECONF server when the CORECONF client is requesting a method not supported on the targeted resource. (e.g., GET on an rpc, PUT or POST on a data node with "config" set to false).

* Error 4.08 (Request Entity Incomplete) is returned by the CORECONF server if one or multiple blocks of a block transfer request is missing, see {{RFC7959}} for more details.

* Error 4.13 (Request Entity Too Large) may be returned by the CORECONF server during a block transfer request, see {{RFC7959}} for more details.

* Error 4.15 (Unsupported Content-Format) is returned by the CORECONF server when the Content-Format used in the request does not match those specified in {{media-type}}.


The CORECONF server MUST also enforce the different constraints associated with the YANG data models implemented. These constraints are described in {{Section 8 of RFC7950}}. These errors are reported using the CoAP error code 4.00 (Bad Request) and may have the following error container as payload. The YANG definition and associated .sid file are available in {{ietf-coreconf-yang}} and {{ietf-coreconf-sid}}. The error container is encoded using the encoding rules of a YANG data template as defined in {{Section 5 of -yang-cbor}}.

   +--rw error-message?        string
~~~~

The following 'error-tag' and 'error-app-tag' are defined by the ietf-coreconf YANG module, these tags are implemented as YANG identity and can be extended as needed.

* error-tag 'operation-failed' is returned by the CORECONF server when the operation request cannot be processed successfully.

  * error-app-tag 'malformed-message' is returned by the CORECONF server when the payload received from the CORECONF client does not contain a well-formed CBOR content as defined in {{RFC8949}} or does not comply with the CBOR structure defined within this document.

  * error-app-tag 'data-not-unique' is returned by the CORECONF server when the validation of the 'unique' constraint of a list or leaf-list fails.

  * error-app-tag 'too-many-elements' is returned by the CORECONF server when the validation of the 'max-elements' constraint of a list or leaf-list fails.

  * error-app-tag 'too-few-elements' is returned by the CORECONF server when the validation of the 'min-elements' constraint of a list or leaf-list fails.

  * error-app-tag 'must-violation' is returned by the CORECONF server when the restrictions imposed by a 'must' statement are violated.

  * error-app-tag 'duplicate' is returned by the CORECONF server when a client tries to create a duplicate list or leaf-list entry.

* error-tag 'invalid-value' is returned by the CORECONF server when the CORECONF client tries to update or create a leaf with a value encoded using an invalid CBOR datatype or if the 'range', 'length', 'pattern' or 'require-instance' constrain is not fulfilled.

  * error-app-tag 'invalid-datatype' is returned by the CORECONF server when CBOR encoding does not follow the rules set by the YANG Build-In type or when the value is incompatible with it (e.g., a value greater than 127 for an int8, undefined enumeration).

  * error-app-tag 'not-in-range' is returned by the CORECONF server when the validation of the 'range' property fails.

  * error-app-tag 'invalid-length' is returned by the CORECONF server when the validation of the 'length' property fails.

  * error-app-tag 'pattern-test-failed' is returned by the CORECONF server when the validation of the 'pattern' property fails.

* error-tag 'missing-element' is returned by the CORECONF server when the operation requested by a CORECONF client fails to comply with the 'mandatory' constraint defined. The 'mandatory' constraint is enforced for leafs and choices, unless the node or any of its ancestors have a 'when' condition or 'if-feature' expression that evaluates to 'false'.

  * error-app-tag 'missing-key' is returned by the CORECONF server to further qualify a missing-element error. This error is returned when the CORECONF client tries to create or list instance, without all the 'key' specified or when the CORECONF client tries to delete a leaf listed as a 'key'.

  * error-app-tag 'missing-input-parameter' is returned by the CORECONF server when the input parameters of an RPC or action are incomplete.

* error-tag 'unknown-element' is returned by the CORECONF server when the CORECONF client tries to access a data node of a YANG module not supported, of a data node associated with an 'if-feature' expression evaluated to 'false' or to a 'when' condition evaluated to 'false'.

* error-tag 'bad-element' is returned by the CORECONF server when the CORECONF client tries to create data nodes for more than one case in a choice.

* error-tag 'data-missing' is returned by the CORECONF server when a data node required to accept the request is not present.

  * error-app-tag 'instance-required' is returned by the CORECONF server when a leaf of type 'instance-identifier' or 'leafref' marked with require-instance set to 'true' refers to an instance that does not exist.

  * error-app-tag 'missing-choice' is returned by the CORECONF server when no nodes exist in a mandatory choice.

* error-tag 'error' is returned by the CORECONF server when an unspecified error has occurred.

For example, the CORECONF server might return the following error.

# Security Considerations

For secure network management, it is important to restrict access to configuration variables
only to authorized parties. CORECONF re-uses the security mechanisms already available to CoAP,
this includes DTLS {{RFC6347}}{{-dtls13}} and OSCORE {{RFC8613}} for protected access to
resources, as well as suitable authentication and authorization mechanisms, for
example those defined in ACE OAuth {{RFC9200}}.

All the security considerations of {{RFC7252}}, {{RFC7959}}, {{RFC8132}} and
{{RFC7641}} apply to this document as well. The use of NoSec ({{Section 9 of RFC7252}}), when OSCORE
is not used, is NOT RECOMMENDED.

In addition, mechanisms for authentication and authorization may need to be
selected if not provided with the CoAP security mode.

As {{-yang-cbor}} and {{RFC4648}} are used for payload and SID
encoding, the security considerations of those documents also need to be
well-understood.

# Acknowledgments
{:unnumbered}

We are very grateful to {{{Bert Greevenbosch}}} who was one of the original authors
of the CORECONF specification.

{{{Mehmet Ersue}}} and {{{Bert Wijnen}}} explained the encoding aspects of PDUs transported
under SNMP.
{{{Koen Zandberg}}}'s implementation input motivated massively simplifying
(and fixing) the URI construction for GET/PUT/POST requests.

The draft has further benefited from comments (alphabetical order) by
{{{Rodney Cummings}}},
{{{Dee Denteneer}}},
{{{Esko Dijk}}},
{{{Klaus Hartke}}},
{{{Michael van Hartskamp}}},
{{{Tanguy Ropitault}}},
{{{JÃ¼rgen SchÃ¶nwÃ¤lder}}},
